            <p>JAPAN</p>
            <p2>I just recently traveled to Japan. It was a wonderful trip, a once
              in a lifetime trip. I have been all over the world, England, France, Mexico,
              Canada, British Virgin Islands, US Vergin Islands and all over the 
              United States, but have never felt as safe and welcomed as I did in Japan.
              The people there are absolutely friendly and nice. I never once felt unsafe 
              or even a little afraid. The country was cleaner than Canada and had 
              buildings and areas much older than Europe.
