          JAPAN
      </div>
      <div class= "paragraph2">I just recently traveled to Japan. It was a wonderful trip, a once
          in a lifetime trip. I have been all over the world, England, France, Mexico,
          Canada, British Virgin Islands US Vergin Islands and all over the 
          United States, but have never felt as safe and welcomed as I did in Japan.
          The people there are absolutely friendly and nice. I never once felt unsafe 
          or even a little afraid. The country was cleaner than Canada and had 
          buildings and areas much older than Europe.</div>
