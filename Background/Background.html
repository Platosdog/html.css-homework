        <div class= "left">I just recently traveled to Japan. It was a wonderful trip, a once
            in a lifetime trip. Few countries blend ancient customs with modern-day innovations as seamlessly as Japan. On this journey, find your Zen in the Japanese Alps and step inside shrines built by emperors in Kyoto. Savor dishes the Japanese have perfected—ramen and sushi, anyone?—and enjoy guided meditation, geisha sightings, and a sake tasting. Then, when you think things can’t get any more astounding, look to the horizon in Tokyo, where skyscrapers and iconic Mount Fuji anchor the skyline.

          Tsukiji Market is Japan’s “Food Town,” where one can encounter all kinds of Japanese traditional foods. A mixture of wholesale and retail shops along with numerous restaurants line the streets and new culinary trends are born here.

      Originally Tsukiji Market used to be the wholesale market for the professionals.
      That is why items sold there were generally too big for a small family to buy.
      However, some of the wholesale shops in the market have started retailing high-end merchandises for ordinary customers. For example, ready-to-eat omelets for sushi are now sold in smaller sizes.
      Even a bite-sized egg roll can be had for those who just want to try it.
      Tsukiji Market, primarily catering to the professionals, has recently opened its doors to ordinary customers and visitors.
      The following is how the market has become well known and shaped into what it looks now.
